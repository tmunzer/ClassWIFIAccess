This app is designed to provide a quick and easy way for teachers to enable or disable Wi-Fi on Aerohive Devices.\r\n\r\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for more details.\r\n\r\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\n#Installation\r\n##First Run\r\nTo run this App, you need NodeJS and NodeJS packages:\r\n\r\n1. Download and Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)\r\n2. From the project root folder, run \r\n    npm install\r\n3. Configure the app with your [Aerohive Developer information](https://developer.aerohive.com/):\r\n    - Copy/Paste the file `/bin/ah_api/config_example` to `/bin/ah_api/config`\r\n    - Edit the file `/bin/ah_api/config` to match your developer credentials\r\n\r\n    By default (if you are not changing the server listening port), the redirectUrl should be     `https://127.0.0.1:3443/conf/api/reg`\r\n4. Once done, you can start the APP. Go to `root_folder/bin/`and execute \"www\". If `node`is not in your $PATH, you may have to start the server from a terminal: `path_to_node/node ./bin/www`\r\n5. Go to https://127.0.0.1:3443/login\r\n\r\n##First Login\r\nThe default credentials are:\r\n\r\n- login: admin\r\n- password: aerohive\r\n\r\n##Initial Configuration\r\nOnce you are logged in for the first time, you still need a few steps:\r\n\r\n- Go to the Configuration Page ![ConfigurationPage](http://i.imgur.com/weyxtOc.png)\r\n    - Go to \"School Management\"\r\n        - Click \"New School\" to create a new School. You'll be able to select the access method (used by ClassWIFIAccess to control Aerohive Access Points). **Currently, only SSH is available**, the API access method will be available as soon as Aerohive Control APIs are available. \r\n    - Go to \"API Configuration\"\r\n        - Click \"Register APP\": this will allow ClassWIFIAccess to get the needed credentials to request Aerohive HiveManager NG API\r\n        - On the \"API Configuration\" page, under the \"School\" column, click on \"None\" to assign the new API parameters to one of the configured School\r\n    - Go to \"Classrooms Management\"\r\n        - Click \"New Classroom\" to create a new classroom and assign a device. A classroom can have only one device, but a device can be assigned to several classrooms.\r\n\r\n#Menus\r\n- ![ClassroomPage](http://i.imgur.com/PAQIdIT.png) **Classroom Page**:\r\n    - This page will list all the classrooms configured for a school, and the status of the assigned device. \r\n    - From this page, a user can enable/disable the Wi-Fi for a classroom, or access to all the schedules for this classroom.\r\n    - All the users (admin, operator and teacher) can access to this page\r\n- ![LessonPage](http://i.imgur.com/7W2MSrr.png) **Lesson Page**:\r\n    - This page will list all the lessons/schedules for a school or for a classroom. \r\n    - From this page, a user can enable/disable the Wi-Fi for a classroom, or schedule an activation.\r\n    - All the users (admin, operator and teacher) can access to this page\r\n- ![DevicePage](http://i.imgur.com/YWBClPv.png) **Devices Page**:\r\n    - This page will list all the devices connected to HiveManager NG.
